#### Scenario:
#### There are investors who want to build a restaurant and they want the restaurant to have a Yelp rating of more than 4.0 stars. They are curious to know more about which characteristics are important for high-rated restaurants.
#### 1. How are high-rated restaurants distributed across the cities? Which cities have the highest number of high-rated restaurants?
#### 2. Which neighborhoods in those cities have the high-rated restaurants in each city?
#### 3. Which cuisines or food types are the most common among those high-rated restaurants?
#### 4. Which times of the day are the most popular among those high-rated restaurants?
#### 5. Explore what other attributes do high-rated restaurants contain.
#### File resources: (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/json).
#### Used the business.json and checkin.json files from the Yelp dataset. These datasets contained the information needed to analyze the questions above.Converted the business.json dataset into a csv file and read the csv into MySQL database to analyze the attribute column using SQL queries.
